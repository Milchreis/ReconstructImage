# ReconstructImage
ReconstructImage is the result of a step into the world of evolutionary algorithms with processing. I want to try to implement an algorithm which reconstruct an image (in tiles f.e. rect, circles ...) by a fitness function and simple mutation. Elements underneath the threshold dies and will be reborn with a random color. More fit elements will mutate in each generation until the fitniss is perfect (100%).

**TLDR;**

`Processing` + `evolutionary algorithm` + `images` = *ReconstructImage*
